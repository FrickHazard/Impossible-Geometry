If there is one thing we presume is that we can disern what is real, and what is good.

So badly, we want to know that our perspective represents reailty.

We lie to ourselves to not face the agony of a broken context.

We Live in confusion and change, but pretend that we always know what is true.

We paint a gray world in black and white. 

Yet we know that we are broken people and that our perspectives change over time.

It would foolish of us to ever asume from where we look that what we see is truely there.
