Context is essential.

We use it to understand everything around us.

Humans are completely inseperable from our own context and perspective. We have no ability to reason outside it.

When we were children we had a different perspective and understood situations and events very differently.

But now that our perspective has grown when we think about those memories they seem different than what they were.

We cannot but help inturpreting old memories by our current context, and in thus doing so, change them.

We walk back to memories with a new context and new understanding and we remove our old context and perspective.

Soon our memories are more of what we tell ourselves that what we rember.
