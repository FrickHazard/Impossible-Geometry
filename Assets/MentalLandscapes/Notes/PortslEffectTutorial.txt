Render "inside" of portal with another camera in a RenderTexture
Make sure the projection matrix of that camera "cuts" whatever is behind the portal in the inside room ( Oblique Near Plane Clipping )
(VR) Render it again for the other eye
Draw the portal as a flat plane when you are away from it and use the RenderTexture in screenspace to draw the inside of the portal
If you touch the portal, it becomes an open box as you step inside it. You are literally stepping INSIDE it.
If you get out of the portal on the other side, flip the portal. Make it a plane again. Flip the camera settings with the ones from "inside" (skybox, layermask, etc.)
If you come out of the portal same way you went in, turn it back into a flat plane
